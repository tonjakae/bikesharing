# bikesharing
For this analysis, I’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

What I'm Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
