# Bikesharing
For this analysis, I’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, I’ll add these new visualizations to the two I created in this module for my final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

What I'm Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present my results. I will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

# Analysis

After careful review of the data, I have found that most of the trip for August have taken place on Monday - Friday in the early hours of the morning as travelers are making their way to work and school.  Trips peak during the 8 am hour and return to normal just after 9am.  Traveling again starts to pick up in the early evening hours as these same travelers are ending their day with heaving traffic occuring between the hours of 5 and 7 pm. Interestingly, Wednesday evenings show a sharp contrast in trips compared to the rest of the work week showing that travel on this day is cut in half.  Weekend bikers travel typically in the afternoon time as the weather is warmest and people are enjoying the day.

The above analysis is consistent with each gender as well for times that most trips are taken however, men more that double and even triple the other gender's usage of CitiBike, making them an ideal target for marketing.
